      My strongest personality traits are creativity and resilience.
      Creativity enables me to think outside the box, express myself 
      through drawing and design, and find innovative solutions to problems. 
      Resilience keeps me focused and determined, even when faced with academic
      challenges.

    <h2>General Validity</h2><!--General Valditiy-->
    <p>
        Personality tests often provide a structured framework to understand 
        preferences, behaviors, and motivations. However, their validity can 
        be limited by subjective interpretations, cultural biases, and the 
        lack of standardized scoring methods. The broad categories such as 
        Materialistic, Thinking, and Interpersonal suggest an attempt to 
        capture a wide range of personality traits, but the results might 
        not always comprehensively or accurately represent a person.

  <section id="individual-validity">
    <h2>Individual Validity</h2><!--Individual Validity-->
    <p>
        The results of the Personality Test don't fully match how 
        I see myself. For example, it suggests that I'm not very materialistic, 
        but I actually consider myself to be quite materialistic. The test also 
        implies that I think a lot, but honestly, my mind tends to be lazy most 
        of the time. Additionally, it portrays me as easygoing, which isn't 
        accurate I wouldn't describe myself that way. These differences make me 
        question how well the test captures my true personality, as I find 
        personality traits to be more complex than simple percentages.
